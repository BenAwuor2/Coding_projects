## Objective
The goal is to build a drum kit app that runs in the browser. 
### Concepts covered
The main concepts presented are **DOM**, **key events** and **CSS** animations. So by the end, you would have not only understood how to add event listeners to buttons and keystrokes so that you’ll know when the user is tapping on the keyboard or clicking on a particular button on your Website and you can respond to it.
### How it works
So the way this website would work that we’ve got a number of keys on the webpage that represents different drums in a typical drum set and when you click on any of those buttons then you’ll get the corresponding sound of the drum. And in addition you can also use the keys on the keyboard to have a sound effect.
